# Explore-multi-layer-perceptron-models

This project objective is to explore different multi-layer perceptron models and their performances. For optimization algorithms, I explored SGD (stochastic gradient descent) and L-BFGS (limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno).
For activation algorithms, I explored ReLU (rectified linear unit) and Sigmoid. I combined pairs of optimization and activation algorithms them compared the performances. 
Finally, I analyzed the loss curves of the various model runs already completed and made some suggestions about which activation functions seem easier to optimize.
